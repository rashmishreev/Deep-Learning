Develop Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Binary and Multi-Class Classification using the MNIST digit dataset. For Binary Classification, train models to distinguish selected digits, explore different weight initializers, and evaluate performance with confusion matrices and learning curves. In Multi-Class Classification, build a comprehensive model considering all 10 classes, incorporating early stopping and presenting a detailed confusion matrix analysis.

Assignment 2 involves the implementation of a CNN for the Fashion Mnist dataset, encompassing 5 layers, Batch Normalization, and MaxPooling. The process includes the application of 5-fold cross-validation and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. The assignment explores techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning using VGG-19. Additionally, a ResNet model is developed. The overarching objective is to employ a diverse set of deep learning methodologies on the Fashion Mnist Dataset, covering CNNs, hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, transfer learning, and ResNet architectures.

Implementing a Variational Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST, visualize latent space clustering, and conduct sentiment analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews using TF-IDF + GaussianNB, Word2Vec + GaussianNB, and Glove + GaussianNB models. Compare their performances and apply Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to varying percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) of the IMDB training dataset, comparing token counts.
