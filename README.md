Develop Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Binary and Multi-Class Classification using the MNIST digit dataset. For Binary Classification, train models to distinguish selected digits based on student ID, exploring different weight initializers and evaluating performance with confusion matrices and learning curves. In Multi-Class Classification, build a comprehensive model considering all 10 classes, incorporating early stopping and presenting a detailed confusion matrix analysis.
