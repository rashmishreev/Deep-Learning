Develop Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Binary and Multi-Class Classification using the MNIST digit dataset. For Binary Classification, train models to distinguish selected digits, explore different weight initializers, and evaluate performance with confusion matrices and learning curves. In Multi-Class Classification, build a comprehensive model considering all 10 classes, incorporating early stopping and presenting a detailed confusion matrix analysis.

Assignment 2 implements a CNN for Fashion Mnist with 5 layers, Batch Normalization, and MaxPooling, applying 5-fold cross-validation and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. It explores data augmentation, and transfer learning with VGG-19, and develops a ResNet model. The goal is to employ various deep learning methods on the Fashion Mnist Dataset, covering CNNs, hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, transfer learning, and ResNet architectures.

Implementing a Variational Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST, visualize latent space clustering, and conduct sentiment analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews using TF-IDF + GaussianNB, Word2Vec + GaussianNB, and Glove + GaussianNB models. Compare their performances and apply Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to varying percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) of the IMDB training dataset, comparing token counts.
